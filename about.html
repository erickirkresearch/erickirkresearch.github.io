      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences department at Utah State University. I am motivated by a desire to improve how people learn to use science to make sense of the world, improve their lives, and better the world more broadly. My work focuses on how people reason about complex socioscientific problems, and how their ideas about knowledge and knowing shape that reasoning. I investigate and design issues-based resources that target learners’ epistemic cognition, causal reasoning, perspective-taking, and use of representations to cultivate socioscientific reasoning and scientific literacy. Before receiving my doctorate in the Learning Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I received my B.A. in Biology, my M.A.T. in Science Education, and taught high school Environmental Science and AP Biology.
